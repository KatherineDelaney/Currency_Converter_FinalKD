Study Abroad Currency Converter - a currency converter specifically designed to help study abroad students 

## Project Description

Study Abroad Pay is a web application designed to help students manage currency conversions while studying abroad. The app allows users to convert between multiple currencies, save conversion history, and view past conversions in both list and chart form. This helps students better understand spending patterns and exchange rate changes over time.
The application uses a simple frontend built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The backend is built with Node.js and Express and stores conversion history in a Supabase database. An external currency API is used to calculate real time exchange rates.

- Google Chrome on Windows and macOS
- Safari on macOS and iOS
